## Goals for Today

###### *What are the most critical tasks I plan to tackle today?*

1. Build out the functionality of the SignalR server.
   1. Facilitates the two devices connection and stores it's state.
   2. Allows each device to send messages of varying types to each other.
2. Check in on StackOverflow to they if they have any suggestions for me about fixing my LAN firewall issue.

## Accomplishments

###### *What did I actually complete?*

* Set up a postman collection for testing the API.
* Each new connection to the server registers as a new "device" in the system, and it is an enforced rule that only one "device" can exist per connection.

## Challenges & Blockers

###### *What problems did I run into? Even small frustrations are worth noting.*

* Nothing crazy today.

## Learnings & Key Takeaways

###### *What did I learn today? Could be a new skill, trick, process, or even a fun fact!*

* I spent a small amount time trying to figure out if I could pass the "isHost" value from the device to the server the moment the connection is established in "OnConnectedAsync". There may be a way to do just that but instead i'll have the client send all needed initialization data to the server manually.
  * You can do it with HttpContext but Microsoft says not to since it might not always work: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/httpcontext?view=aspnetcore-9.0
  * That took me too much time to decide. In the future I'll remember the benefits of rapid prototyping and iteration.

## Tomorrow's Plan

###### *Based on today's progress, what are the next steps?*

1. Send "Hosts" a list of unassigned guests so they can pick who they want to establish a connection with.
   1. Expand the network test scene so that we can view all of the free guests when hosting.
2. Once the connection is established all the server needs to do is ensure that messages get between the host and guest in each pairing correctly.

## Notes

###### *Other thoughts that I felt needed to be written down.*

I should've gotten more done today, I'll need to find a balance between architecting and building in the future!
