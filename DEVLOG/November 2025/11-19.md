# SageXR Devlog: [11-19-2025]

## Goals for Today

What are the most critical tasks I plan to tackle today?

1. Add ability to connect two devices via TCP socket through a manual handoff of the host's IP encoded as a series of 3 letter words.
2. Establish some kind of standard message format for the backend.

## Accomplishments

What did I actually complete?

* Build out the network test scene's functionality so that I can more easily test the system before implementing it into the larger project.

* **Bug Fix:** Resolved the critical bug where \[Bug Description\].

  * Details: \[e.g., The issue was a misplaced semi-colon in the core loop; test coverage is now 90%.\]

## Challenges & Blockers

What problems did I run into? Even small frustrations are worth noting.

* Connecting to another device via its public IP requires it to get that address from the web which is kind of unfortunate since I want to avoid using external webpages for this.
  * So now I need to revisit the idea of looping through all the possible IPs in the hosts subnet mask...
* My work PC (and many of the PCs that SageXR would run on) have strict firewalls that prevents inbound connection requests. This means that I am required to make whichever device with the least strict firewall be the host...
* I mayyy need to accept defeat on this one... I asked Stack Overflow what I can do about this firewall situation and hopefully they give me some good ideas. Otherwise i'll just give up and do the connection via some kind of server middleman.

## Learnings & Key Takeaways

What did I learn today? Could be a new skill, trick, process, or even a fun fact!

* \[e.g., Always validate environment variables *before* running the database migration script.\]

* \[e.g., Discovered a neat trick using `Array.prototype.flat()` for flattening deep arrays in JavaScript.\]

## Tomorrow's Plan

Based on today's progress, what are the next steps?

1. \[Next Task 1: e.g., Write unit tests for the newly implemented authentication flow.\]

2. \[Next Task 2: e.g., Start design mockups for the dashboard UI.\]

3. \[Documentation/Cleanup: e.g., Delete deprecated files from the `v1` branch.\]

## Notes
