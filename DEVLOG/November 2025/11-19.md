## Goals for Today

###### *What are the most critical tasks I plan to tackle today?*

1. Add ability to connect two devices via TCP socket through a manual handoff of the host's IP encoded as a series of 3 letter words.
2. Establish some kind of standard message format for the backend.

## Accomplishments

###### *What did I actually complete?*

* Build out the network test scene's functionality so that I can more easily test the system before implementing it into the larger project.
  * Not as much as I would've liked. Spent way more time researching fixes to the LAN issue and then adding SignalR as a plugin.

* Created a new GitHub project for the remote backend server.
  * The server will utilize websockets via SignalR.

## Challenges & Blockers

###### *What problems did I run into? Even small frustrations are worth noting.*

* Connecting to another device via its public IP requires it to get that address from the web which is kind of unfortunate since I want to avoid using external webpages for this.
  * So now I need to revisit the idea of looping through all the possible IPs in the hosts subnet mask...
* My work PC (and many of the PCs that SageXR would run on) have strict firewalls that prevents inbound connection requests. This means that I am required to make whichever device with the least strict firewall be the host...
  * I mayyy need to accept defeat on this one... I asked Stack Overflow what I can do about this firewall situation and hopefully they give me some good ideas. Otherwise i'll just give up and do the connection via some kind of server middleman.

    * I ended up just switching to making a remote server for now, hopefully I'll find some solution for LAN connectivity in the future.
  
## Learnings & Key Takeaways

###### *What did I learn today? Could be a new skill, trick, process, or even a fun fact!*

* When adding a new plugin to Unity make sure to rebuild the project files to allow your IDE to see the new libraries.
  * Edit > Preferences, Select External Tools from the left-hand menu, and Click the Regenerate project files button.
* Programmatically getting your device's public IP is much harder than getting its private one for some reason. Most online solutions involve sending a GET request to some website.
* Firewalls block incoming connection requests, but generally allow 2-way connections that are established from an outgoing request (from the perspective of the firewalled device). 

## Tomorrow's Plan

###### *Based on today's progress, what are the next steps?*

1. Build out the functionality of the SignalR server.
   1. Facilitates the two devices connection and stores it's state.
   2. Allows each device to send messages of varying types to each other.
2. Check in on StackOverflow to they if they have any suggestions for me about fixing my LAN firewall issue.

## Notes

###### *Other thoughts that I felt needed to be written down.*

Nothing today!
