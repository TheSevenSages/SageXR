# SageXR Devlog: \[11-19-2025\]

## Goals for Today

What are the most critical tasks I plan to tackle today?

1. Add ability to connect two devices via TCP socket through a manual handoff of the host's IP encoded as a series of 3 letter words.
2. Establish some kind of standard message format for the backend.

## Accomplishments

What did I actually complete?

* **Feature/Task 1:** Successfully implemented the new \[Feature Name\] functionality.

  * Details: \[e.g., Used the new `AuthService` class and ensured all credentials are encrypted.\]

* **Bug Fix:** Resolved the critical bug where \[Bug Description\].

  * Details: \[e.g., The issue was a misplaced semi-colon in the core loop; test coverage is now 90%.\]

## Challenges & Blockers

What problems did I run into? Even small frustrations are worth noting.

* **Blocker:** Spent time debugging an issue with the third-party API webhook setup.

  * Status: **Resolved** / **Still Blocked**

  * Root Cause: \[e.g., Incorrectly formatted JSON payload due to a missing header.\]

* **Learning Curve:** The new \[Technology/Concept\] is proving more complex than anticipated. Need to allocate more time for documentation review tomorrow.

## Learnings & Key Takeaways

What did I learn today? Could be a new skill, trick, process, or even a fun fact!

* \[e.g., Always validate environment variables *before* running the database migration script.\]

* \[e.g., Discovered a neat trick using `Array.prototype.flat()` for flattening deep arrays in JavaScript.\]

## Tomorrow's Plan

Based on today's progress, what are the next steps?

1. \[Next Task 1: e.g., Write unit tests for the newly implemented authentication flow.\]

2. \[Next Task 2: e.g., Start design mockups for the dashboard UI.\]

3. \[Documentation/Cleanup: e.g., Delete deprecated files from the `v1` branch.\]
