An XR project for me to test Apple Vision Pro development in Unity, asymmetric user experiences across platforms (Windows version and AVP version), and AI integration.

Right now this application does not use a centralized server to connect the devices, but if I ever add that as an option...
  Server code can be found here (for those that have access): https://github.com/TheSevenSages/SageXR.Server
